INSTALL / CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------
Install and enable as you would any feature for Atrium, remembering to enable it for a group.
You also need to configure which items your allowing time to be logged against:
/admin/content/node-type/logged-time/fields

IMPORTANT
-------------
Currently needs a modified version of nodereferance_url

TODO
-------------------------
 * Admin interface to have another interface for /admin/content/node-type/logged-time/fields and also then display the summary view on the /node/X pages for nodes of that content type
 * Cleaning it up theme wise, beautifying the output. 

+ Lots more, its a very early version, there is no reporting interface or complex features.
